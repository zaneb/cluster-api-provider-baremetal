# Cluster API Provider for Managed Bare Metal Hardware

This repository contains a Machine actuator implementation for the
Kubernetes [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/).

For more information about this actuator and related repositories, see
[metal3.io](http://metal3.io/).

## Development Environment

* See [metal3-dev-env](https://github.com/metal3-io/metal3-dev-env) for an
  end-to-end development and test environment for
  `cluster-api-provider-baremetal` and
  [baremetal-operator](https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator).
* [Setting up for tests](docs/dev/setup.md)
* Using [Minikube](docs/dev/minikube.md)
* Using [OpenShift 4](docs/dev/openshift.md)

## API

See the [API Documentation](docs/api.md) for details about the `providerSpec`
API used with this `cluster-api` provider.

## MachineSet Scaling

If you would like a MachineSet to be automatically scaled to the number of
matching BareMetalHosts, annotate that MachineSet with key
`metal3.io/autoscale-to-hosts` and any value.

When reconciling a MachineSet, the controller will count all of the
BareMetalHosts that either:
* match the MachineSet's `Spec.Template.Spec.ProviderSpec.HostSelector` and
  have a ConsumerRef that is `nil`
* has a ConsumerRef that references a Machine that is part of the MachineSet

This ensures that in case a BareMetalHost has previously been consumed by a
Machine, but either labels or selectors have since been changed, it will
continue to get counted with the MachineSet that its Machine belongs to.

## Machine Remediation

MachineHealthCheck Controller in [Machine-API operator](https://github.com/openshift/machine-api-operator) is checking Node's health.
If you would like to remediate unhealthy Machines you should add the following
to MachineHealthCheck CR:
```
annotations:
   machine.openshift.io/remediation-strategy: external-baremetal
```

Remediation is done by power-cycling the Host associated with the unhealthy Machine,
using [BMO reboot API](https://github.com/metal3-io/metal3-docs/blob/master/design/reboot-interface.md)

Remediation steps (triggered by the annotation mentioned above):
1) Power off the host
2) Add poweredOffForRemediation annotation to the unhealthy Machine
3) Delete the node
4) Power on the host
5) Wait for the node the come up (by waiting for the node to be registered in the cluster)
6) Remove poweredOffForRemediation annotation and the MAO's machine unhealthy annotation
